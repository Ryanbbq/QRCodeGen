This program takes in a picture and changes it into a QR code depending on the option that the
user picks.
The program formats the size of the picture and makes sure that the QR Code will be the correct
dimensions.

Note: You must have tkinter,PIL,qrcode, and MyQR to run this file.

To run the program first download and make sure the modules above are imported into python.

1.Pick an option. Option 1 is Jasons QR Code, Option 2 is Ryans QR Code.

2. Enter the Url... make sure to press submit and make sure it prints out in the console.

3. Copy and paste the file output directory (where you want the qr code to be generated)
	Note: you do not have to do this for Ryans QR code

4. Enter the size of the QR code, it must be between 1-40.
	Note 1 is smallest, 40 is biggest

5. Choose the desired picture on your computer and press Run!

QR code will be generated once all values are entered and Run is pressed.
